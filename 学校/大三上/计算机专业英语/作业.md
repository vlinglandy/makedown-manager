Unit 4 Operating System

Summary of OS
An operating system is the software which acts as an interface between a user of a computer and the component handware. The purpose of operating system is to provide a environment in which a user may execute programs. The primary goal of an operating system is thus to make the computer system convenient to use.A secondary goal is to use the

which may be required to solvea problem:CPU time,memory space,file storag
input/ouput (1O)devices,and so on.The operating system acts as the manager of these
esodaes them to specific programs and users as necessary for their tasks.Since
there may be many,possibly conflicting,requests for resources,the operating systemmust

Early computers were (physically)very large machines run from a console.The
programer would write a program and then operate the program directly from the operator's
console.Software such as assemblers,loaders,and compilers improved on the convenience of
programming the system,but also required substantial setup time.To reduce the setup time,
operators were hired and similar jobs were batched together.

Batch sysem allowed automatic job sequencing by a resident monitor and improved the
raluilization of the computer greatly.The computer no longer had to wait for human
operation.CPU utilization was still low,however,because of the slow speed of the I/O devices
relative to the CPU.Offline operation of slow devices was tried.
Buffering was another approach to improving system performance by overlapping the
input,output,and computation of a single job.Finally,spooling allowed the CPU to overlap
the input of one job with the computation and output of other jobs.
Spooling also provides a pool of jobs which have been read and are waiting to be run.
This job pool supports the concept of multiprogramming.With multiprogramming,several
jobs are kept in memory at one time;the CPU is switched back and forth between them in
order toincrease CPU utilization and to decrease the total real time needed to execute a job.
Multiprogramming,which was developed to improve performance,also allows time
sharing.
Time-shared operating systems allow many users(from one to several hundred)to use a

to the next,each user is given the impression that he has his own computer.Other operating
systems types include real-time systems and multiprocessor systems.

A real-time system is often used as control device in a dedicated application.Sensors
bring data to the computer.The computer must analyze the data and possibly adjust controls
to modify the sensor inputs.Systems which control scientific experiments,medical computer
systems,industrial control systems,and some display systems are real-time systems.A real-
time operating system has well-defined fixed time constraints.Processing must be done within
a user
the defined constraints,or the system will fail.a
A multiprocessor system has more than one CPU.The obvious advantages would appear
to be greater computing power and reliability.There are various types of operating systems

operating systems for multiple CPU systems:loosely coupled,such as network operating

The operating system must ensure correct operation of the computer system.To prevent

user programs from interfering with the proper operation of the system,the hardware was
modified to create two modes:user mode and monitor mode.Various instructions (such as

the user.A timer prevents infinite loops.Once these changes (dual mode,privileged
instructions,memory protection,timer interrupt)have been made to the basic computer

architecture,it is possible to write a correct operating system.
